This is my first Major project which is still under construction but has been up with the 1st phase and is running. This project name is WanderLust where in its a website from where people can add their stays and hotels in the form of listings and people can view and book it. The project right now focuses on adding and updating those listings and the client side code is still under process.
I have used HTML, CSS for frontend and for backend part I have used MERN stack wherein till now I have worked on MongoDB for collecting the data and acting as a database
Express.js and Node.js is also being used for backend.
I have handled all the possible errors with the help of ExpressErrors handling and also by creating my own custom error handling techniques.
I am also open to any changes or updations required for the betterment of this project.Please feel free to reach out and guide me as well!
Below is a short video attached of the functionalities of this website, though the quality is degraded due to size constraints. But you can get an overview of my project from the same!
